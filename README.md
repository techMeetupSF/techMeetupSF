### Reason for Building 
There are hundreds of tech meetups in San Francisco every week with no way to filter out events with < 10 people.  While these smaller meetups can be interesting, this makes it difficult to find popular meetups.  TechMeetupSF solves this problem...  Here is the trend of users over the past year as of Nov 4th 2018.
