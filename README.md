### What we do?

![TechMeetupSF](www.techmeetupsf.com) is a site for tech meetup discovery.  Not all tech meetups are created equal.  Our goal is to simplifty the process of finding upcoming technically relevant meetups with the best catered food in San Francisco, the tech capital of the world.  Why Meetup.com has decided to make this a difficult process is beyond me.  

### Reason for Building 

At ![TechMeetupSF](www.techmeetupsf.com), we believe that the quality of catered food at tech meetups is indicative of what it is like to work at that company.  We think you do too.  Here is the trend of unique non-bot users over the past year.
